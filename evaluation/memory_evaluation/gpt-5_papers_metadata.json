By blocking precursor adsorption on selected surfaces, film growth is confined within trenches while suppressing deposition on adjacent top surfaces, enabling self-aligned, void-free fills with high selectivity. The study demonstrates the tunability of selectivity via a-C processing conditions and shows that the inhibitor can be cleanly removed (e.g., by oxidative treatments) after deposition, highlighting utility for self-aligned patterning in advanced semiconductor and 3D nanofabrication.' }"

        "response": "{ \"authors\": [], \"year\": null, \"DOI\": \"\", \"summary\": \"Based on the title, the study deposits sub-nanometer Al2O3 coatings on high-Ni LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathode particles using ozone-based atomic layer deposition to enhance both interfacial kinetics and long-term stability. The ultrathin, conformal Al2O3 layer is optimized in thickness to balance protection and Li+ transport, leading to improved rate capability, reduced impedance growth, and better capacity retention—especially at high voltages/temperatures. The coating suppresses parasitic electrolyte oxidation and transition-metal dissolution, stabilizes surface oxygen chemistry, and mitigates microcracking or surface reconstruction. The work likely employs TEM, XPS, EIS, and electrochemical testing to correlate coating thickness with performance and proposes a mechanism where the Al2O3 (and possible Li–Al–O formed in situ) provides a robust, ion-permeable passivation layer.\" }"

Discusses adsorption and desorption kinetics, ligand exchange mechanisms, nucleation delay, and thermodynamic versus kinetic control of selectivity. Provides design guidelines for inhibitor functional groups, coverage, and thermal/chemical stability under ALD conditions; and for precursor ligand choice to maximize reactivity contrast across surfaces (metals, oxides, nitrides). Addresses practical challenges including pattern fidelity, defect formation (pinholes), line edge roughness, process windows, inhibitor removal/regeneration, and integration prospects for semiconductor manufacturing.' }"
