Because common ALD precursors nucleate very slowly on a-C, coating the field region with this layer while leaving the interiors of etched trenches carbon-free confines ALD growth to the recessed features. The authors demonstrate selective deposition of Al2O3 and TiO2 inside sub-50 nm, high-aspect-ratio trenches, achieving void-free gap fill while effectively suppressing film growth on the top surface. The work systematically examines inhibitor thickness, ALD temperature, and cycle number, and shows that the approach can be integrated into semiconductor process flows for self-aligned, bottom-up deposition of functional thin films.\"\n}"

After outlining the fundamental differences between spatial and temporal ALD, the paper discusses reactor architectures (rotary, linear, and roll-to-roll systems), precursor delivery strategies, and growth kinetics at atmospheric and low pressure. It then details how s-ALD is enabling high-throughput fabrication of thin films for photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, electrochromic windows, thermoelectrics, thin-film transistors, sensors, and flexible electronics. Particular emphasis is placed on conformality over large areas, reduced cost-of-ownership compared with conventional ALD, and the remaining challenges such as precursor utilization efficiency, parasitic CVD, and temperature-window limitations. The authors conclude with an outlook on integrating s-ALD into industrial production lines and combining it with other spatially separated vapor-phase techniques for hybrid manufacturing.\"\n}"
