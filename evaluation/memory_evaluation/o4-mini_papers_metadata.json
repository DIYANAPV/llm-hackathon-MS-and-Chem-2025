By selectively blocking precursor adsorption on the plateaus while leaving the trench sidewalls and bottoms exposed, the method enables conformal filling of high‐aspect‐ratio trenches with metal oxide. The authors characterize the inhibition effect, trench filling uniformity, and carbon removal, illustrating a promising route to area‐ and topography‐selective ALD for advanced nanoscale device fabrication.'  \n}"

By precisely controlling the Al₂O₃ layer thickness (0.5–1.0 nm), the authors show significant reductions in interfacial impedance, suppressed transition-metal dissolution, and enhanced rate capability. Advanced characterization (TEM, XPS, EIS) reveals that the ultrathin coating forms a stable Li–Al–O interphase that mitigates electrolyte attack and microcracking. The optimally coated cathode retains over 80% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1 C, highlighting the promise of subnano surface engineering for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.'  \n}"

It examines how surface inhibitors can be engineered to block film growth in unwanted regions and how precursor ligands can be tailored to favor deposition only on target areas. Combining experimental ALD data with density functional theory modeling, the authors identify key structural and electronic features that govern adsorption, reactivity, and selectivity on different substrate chemistries, and they propose guidelines for developing next-generation AS-ALD processes with improved precision and compatibility.\"}"

The authors describe reactor architectures that enable continuous, atmospheric‐pressure processing and discuss key parameters—such as precursor flow dynamics, substrate temperature, and gas‐seal design—that govern film uniformity, conformality, and deposition rate. They highlight applications in energy conversion and storage (including thin‐film solar cells, Li‐ion batteries, and supercapacitors) as well as in microelectronic devices (gate dielectrics, resistive memories), demonstrating how SALD can achieve deposition rates one to two orders of magnitude higher than conventional ALD while maintaining atomic‐scale thickness control. The paper concludes with an outlook on scaling SALD for high‐volume manufacturing and identifies challenges related to precursor volatility, gas‐phase interactions, and large‐area reactor design.\"  \n}"
